			 Part 13: Creating a Font</h2>
			<p>
			 Step 85: Before we can show any text on screen when the player wins the game, we need to create a default Font to use. Click on the Dashboard, then on Fonts, and click the dotted line box to create a new font. Name it Default Font. Change the settings to those shown in the following image (size 32, white for the color, Sans Serif for the font, a style of Normal, Yes for Smoothing) and save your work.</p>
			<p>

			<p>
			 Now we need to create an Event that will check how many Enemy Ships are left on screen, and if none are left, it will display a "victory" message using the font we just created.</p>
			<p>

		 Part 14: Winning the Game</h2>
		<p>
		 Step 86: We now need to create an Event for our Scene that will let the player win. It will check how many Enemy Ships are left, and if the player destroys all of them, the Event will show a message on screen.</p>
		<p>
		 To start, select our Scene from the Dashboard, and add an Actor Event (under Actors in the Event menu) that checks whether Actors in a Collision Group are created or killed. Select the Enemies Group from one dropdown and the killed option from the other, as shown.</p>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image10.png" style="width: 353px; height: 78px;"></p>
		<p>
		 Step 87: Next, create a Number type Attribute called Victory Counter.</p>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image05.png"></p>
		<p>
		 Step 88: In the Event block, add an increment block, and set it to increase the Victory Counter Attribute by 1.</p>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image46.png"></p>
		<p>
		 Step 87: Next, create a When Updated Event (which, as usual, creates an Always block). In it, add a boolean block that checks whether our Victory Counter Attribute is equal to the number of Enemies in our Scene.</p>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image65.png" style="width: 229px; height: 109px;"></p>
		<p>
		 Step 89: Now we need to create another Attribute that we will use to “switch on” the text that will display when the player kills all the Enemy Ships.</p>
		<ol>
		 <li>
		  Create an Attribute of type Boolean called Win?</li>
		 <li>
		  Select the Setter block for this Attribute (under Attributes -&gt; Setters)</li>
		 <li>
		  Put a true block inside it</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image15.png"></p>
		<p>
		 Step 90: Lastly, we need to add a When Drawing Event (under Basics). First, we’ll set the font and then, if our Win? Attribute is true (from the previous Event), we will draw some text on screen.</p>
		<ol>
		 <li>
		  Add the When Drawing Event</li>
		 <li>
		  In the Drawing category, grab the set current font to [ ] block under the Styles subcategory and place it inside the When Drawing block.</li>
		 <li>
		  Drag over an if block, and place the Win? Attribute block in it.</li>
		 <li>
		  Lastly, drag over a draw text&nbsp; [ ] at x [ ], y [ ] block and place it inside the if block. For the text to show, simply type in You Win! Set the coordinates for X and Y to the middle of the Scene (you can move your mouse cursor around in the Scene to find the best coordinates to choose - you can see the coordinates in the lower right of the Scene Editor).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image28.png"></p>
		<p>
		 You’ll end up with the following:</p>
		<p>
		 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 14 on Stencylpedia_files/image105.png"></p>
		<p>
		 Keep in mind that we're setting exact coordinates for where the text should appear. If you change the game window's (viewport's) size to something other than a Width of 640 and a Height of 480, you'll have to adjust the X and Y values shown so the text is centered.</p>
		<p>
		 Step 91: Save your progress and test the game. When the player destroys all the Enemy Ships, the text <strong>You Win!</strong> should be displayed. Now it's time to put a few last touches on our game.</p>

 Part 15: Final Touches</h2>
<p>
 Step 92: Now that you’ve tested your game and everything works, it’s time to export it to your desktop as a SWF file. That way, you can open the file in any browser to play the game! Click the Publish button in the top menu bar, and select Web -> Flash.</p>
<p>
<p>
 Step 93: This will create a SWF file and ask you to choose where to save the file.</p>
<p>
 Step 94: Now that you have your game, you can take on the Challenges that follow, and modify the game further, or you can start on your own game! The choice is yours.</p>
<p>
 Here are a few challenges you could take on if you want to take this project further.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
 Challenges</h2>
<p>
 <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Find a way to make the Enemy Ships move back and forth on screen.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Restrict how frequently the player can fire the cannon, either by setting a maximum for the number of bullets on screen or by limiting how quickly the player’s Ship can fire bullets.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Make the Enemy Ships fire back at the Player.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>
<h2>
 Where do I go from here?</h2>
<p>
 There's a whole lot more to Stencyl, and we encourage you to experiment on your own or read through the Stencylpedia website to find out how to do more with Stencyl.</p>
