Original Stencyl Crash Course ordering:

1. blank game
2. create Ship actor type
	import frames
3. Actor Collisions
	actor groups
4. more actor types
	+ background for some reason
5. importing sounds
6. Creating a Scene
	set background
	place actors
7. Design mode scripting
	- background music
8. making the ship move
	lots of blocks
	attribute
	default attribute value
9. Keeping the ship on screen
	so many blocks
10. ship fires bullets
11. destroying bullets when they go off screen
12. Destroying Enemy Ships
13. Create a font
14. Win condition
	victory counter
15. publish + extra challenges

New ordering:
1. blank game
2. create Ship actor type
	import frames
[6] create a scene
	place ship
[8]. Making the ship move
	(without attributes)
[3]. actor collision groups
[4] more actor types
[10]. ship fires bullets
[12]. Destroying Enemy Ships (without hitpoints or attribute)
[15]. publish + extra challenges

These become optional extras:
	5. sounds + 7 background music
	6. background picture (import background in 4)
	9. keeping the ship on screen
	13 and 14, victory counter and win text
	from 12, enemy hit points and flashing when hit
	from 2, animations with multiple frames

never:
	11. destroy bullets when they go off screen
	in 8, use a variable for ship speed

Other thoughts:
	biggest problem is not knowing where the thing you want to click is.
	Maybe have full screen screenshots with a highlight on what to click.
	(for every click in the whole workshop :/)

Things in the original course that don't need to be there:
	animations \ multiple frames
	background (including scene layers)
	importing sounds
	using an attribute for ship speed (it's totes unneccessary)
	Keeping the ship on screen - move to optional extra
	11. destroying bullets when they go off screen (not important. Could be a one sentence tip)
	in 12, enemy hit points (and enemy flashing when shot)
