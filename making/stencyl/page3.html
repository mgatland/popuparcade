		    <h2>Part 7: Adding Background Music to A Scene</h2>
	<p>
 Step 42: Now we need to add background music. Click the <strong>Events</strong> tab from within the Level One scene, which will bring up Stencyl <em>Design Mode</em>. We can use this to create game logic. In this case, we’re creating an Event directly rather than creating a fully modular Behavior.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When we're more experienced, we will create Behaviors with Events inside them. This lets us reuse the same behavior on different Actor Types. However, for now, we are going to put Events directly onto Actor Types, without using Behaviors.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image86.png" style="width: 459px; height: 30px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 43: Click the <strong>+ Add Event</strong> button in the Events pane on the left, move our mouse over the <strong>Basics</strong> option, and click on the <strong>When Creating</strong> Event.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image04.png" style="width: 360px; height: 309px;"></p>
<p>
 <br>
 The following "Created" event should appear as the first and only entry in our Events list.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image70.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 44: Now that we have the "when created" block in our workspace, we can add logic to our event. If you look all the way to the right, there is a "palette" of different logic blocks available to us, neatly organized into different categories. We are going to work with our music, so click the <strong>Sound &amp; Images</strong> button in the Palette.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2_image79.png" style="width: 413px; height: 286px;"></p>
<p>
 Next, left click and drag the <strong>Play Sound</strong> block in the Playback subcategory (shown above) over into the <strong>When Created</strong> block in the work area, and when the white bar appears, release the button. The block will snap into place.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image97.png" style="width: 208px; height: 105px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 45: Left-click on the Sound dropdown button and a dialog will appear that lets you select which sound to play.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image16.png" style="width: 229px; height: 106px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 46: Click the Choose Sound option and select the song we imported earlier.</p>
<div class="tableWrapper" style="padding:10px;">
 <strong>Tip:</strong> Part 5 of this tutorial covers importing sounds. You can <a href="http://www.stencyl.com/help/viewArticle/175">read about importing sounds again here</a>.</div>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image69.png"></p>
<p>
 The block will change to show the song it will play.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 7 on Stencylpedia_files/image91.png" style="width: 327px; height: 83px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 47: Save your game (press Ctrl S or option S), then press the green Test Scene button. The music should be playing in the background.</p>

<p>
 We'll get to using the Explosion sound effect that we uploaded earlier when we handle destroying the Enemy ships. Now it’s time to move on to an Events that will let the player move the Ship using keyboard keys.</p>

<h2>
 Part 8: Making the Ship Move</h2>
<p>
 We've added an Event to the scene to play our music, now let's add an Event to our player's Ship so they can move it around!</p>
<p>
 Step 48: Click on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab, then on <strong>Actor Types</strong>, and select our <strong>Ship</strong> Actor Type. Now that we’re in the Actor Editor and can edit our Ship, click the <strong>Events</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image06.png" style="width: 477px; height: 30px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 49: What we are looking at is <strong>Design Mode</strong> again, this time for the Ship. We’re going to create an Event that will allow us to move our Ship both left and right in the scene by pressing keyboard keys. To do this, we need to specify what happens when the player presses certain keyboard keys AND what happens when the player isn’t pressing anything.</p>
<p>
 To start, click the <strong>+ Add Event </strong>button in the Events pane on the left, select <strong>Basics</strong>, and then choose <strong>When Updating</strong> from the three options shown.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image26.png" style="width: 548px; height: 185px;"></p>
<p>
 The following block will appear in the work area:</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image87.png" style="width: 309px; height: 146px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 50: This time, rather than dragging a block over from the Palette, we’re going to use the Block Picker. <strong>Right-click</strong> anywhere in the workspace area, mouse over the <strong>Place a Block</strong> option, then over the <strong>Flow</strong> category, then click on the <strong>if</strong> block. That block will appear in the work area where you first right-clicked.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image115.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 51: We drag the if block into the Always block so it snaps in place.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image68.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 52: Now we need to select the right block to go inside the hexagonal field in our If block. Click the empty hexagonal field (this shape is always for a boolean, i.e. a value that can be true or false) in the block and a new dialog will pop up. Mouse over the<strong> User Input</strong> category, and then choose the <strong>Control is Down</strong> block.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2_image11.png" style="width: 483px; height: 334px;"></p>
<p>
 The Control is Down block will appear for us in the If block, as shown below.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image09.png" style="width: 274px; height: 123px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 53: The Always block will constantly run through all the logic inside of it while the game runs. Putting an if block inside an always block lets us turn on or off some action, so it runs constantly <strong>if</strong> a certain condition is met.</p>
<p>
 Click the <strong>Control</strong> dropdown on the block and select <strong>Choose Control</strong>, then pick <strong>right</strong> from the list.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image78.png"></p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image48.png"></p>
<p>
 Again, the block will change to reflect this choice.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image106.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 54: Next, we need to go to the <strong>Actor </strong>category of the palette and select the <strong>Motion </strong>sub-category and find the <strong>Set X Speed to [0] for Self </strong>block, as shown below.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image58.png" style="width: 400px; height: 282px;"></p>
<p>
 This block will allow us to control the ship's speed. Drag it over to the work area, and snap it inside the if block's empty space so it looks like the image below.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image120.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 55: We now need to create an Attribute that we can use to adjust the value for x-speed. By doing this we won’t need to edit the speed value directly on the block in our Event every time we want to tweak it. To do this, let's click the <strong>Attributes</strong> category on the Palette, then click the <strong>Create an Attribute</strong> button.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image42.png" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;"></p>
<p>
 In the dialog that appears, we will give our new attribute a <strong>Name of "Ship Speed"</strong> and set the <strong>Type to "Number"</strong>. Click OK to continue.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2_image83.png" style="width: 450px; height: 240px;"></p>
<p>
 Now you’ve got a blue block for the Ship Speed Attribute that you can set to different numeric values. We’ll show you how to set its value later when we complete this Event.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image18.png" style="width: 337px; height: 65px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 56: Click on the <strong>empty</strong> number field in the <strong>set x-speed to [ ] for [Self]</strong> block, select <strong>Attributes</strong> in the pop-up dialog, and choose the one we just created, <strong>Ship Speed</strong>.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image00.png"></p>
<p>
 As you would expect, the block will appear in the field.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image121.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 57: Next, go to the <strong>Flow</strong> category, <strong>Conditions</strong> sub-category in the Palette and drag the <strong>otherwise if</strong> block over to the work area.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image62.png"></p>
<p>
 Snap the otherwise if block <strong>under the if block</strong> inside the Always Event block, as shown.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image99.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 58: Now we need to set up what happens when the user presses the left key instead of the right key. Get another <strong>Control is Down</strong> block and set it to <strong>left</strong>. We now need another "set x-speed to [Ship Speed] for [Self]" block.</p>
<div class="tableWrapper" style="padding:10px;">
 <strong>Tip:</strong> To easily duplicate a block, hold down <strong>ALT </strong>and click-and-drag the block you want to duplicate. If there are other blocks nested inside of the one you drag, they will be duplicated as well. You can use this to quickly copy a whole stack of blocks!</div>
<p>
 Once we have our second x-speed block with the Ship Speed inside of it, we need to make a slight change to have the Ship move left. Because <em>positive </em>speed values move an actor to the <em>right</em>, we have to use a <strong>negative </strong>value to make the actor move <strong>left</strong> instead.</p>
<p>
 To do this, insert a <strong>negate </strong>block (it's in the <strong>Numbers &amp; Text</strong> category, <strong>Math </strong>sub-category) to the field where Ship Speed would go, then replace Ship Speed <em>inside </em>the negate block. This block will take the number inside of it and make it a negative; thus making our Ship Speed work for moving left without needing a second number.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image22.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 59: If we were to set Ship Speed to a value and test now, we could press left and right to make our ship move in those directions at the desired speed. However, we'd quickly notice an issue; it won't stop moving!</p>
<p>
 This is because our logic sets the X-speed to a value, but never resets it to 0 when a key is <em>not </em>being pressed. To fix this, we need to add one more conditional block. Find and insert an  <strong>otherwise</strong> block below the otherwise if block shown previously.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./new/otherwise.png"></p>

<p>
 Step 60: Grab the set<strong> x-speed to [ ] for [Self] </strong>block again, click the [x-speed] dropdown on the block, and set the value in the field to <strong>0</strong>. Then snap it in place. Here's the complete Event.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./new/ship_step_62.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 61: The last thing we need to do is set the Ship Speed value. Click on the <strong>Attributes tab </strong>at the bottom of the entire Palette.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image52.png"></p>
<p>
 Then set the <strong>Ship Speed</strong> Attribute’s <strong>Default Value</strong> to <strong>20</strong>.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 8 on Stencylpedia_files/image23.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 62: Test the game to make sure the Ship moves from left to right and stops when you let go of a key.</p>

<h2>
 Part 9: Keeping the Ship On Screen</h2>
<p>
 You probably played around with the game so far and noticed something; the ship can go off the screen (and doesn't come back!). Let's fix that, we need to restrict the Ship’s position so it can’t go past the screen’s edge.</p>

<p>Switch back to the <strong>palette</strong>, with the button at the bottom right of the screen.</p>

 <img alt="" src="./new/palette.png"></p>

<p>
 Step 66: Create a <em>new </em><strong>When Updating </strong>Event for the <strong>Ship</strong>. We need to add an <strong>If </strong>and an <strong>Otherwise If</strong> block inside.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_ifotherwiseif.png"></p>
<p>
 We will use the first to check if the Ship’s position on screen is beyond the left-most edge of the screen (an X position of 0). The second will check if it’s past the right-most edge (a value equal to the screen’s width) of the screen.</p>
<p>
 Note that it will need to take into account the Ship’s width. Stencyl measures an Actor’s x position from the left-most edge of the graphic; if we didn't account for the Ship's width, the right side of the ship could go further than the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>
 Step 67: For our conditions, we need to compare two numbers; the Ship's position and the left or right edge of the screen. Let's grab the <strong>Greater Than</strong> and the <strong>Less Than</strong> blocks from palette. You can find them in the <strong>Flow </strong>category, <strong>Conditions </strong>sub-category, in the <strong>Equality </strong>section.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_greater_than_less_than.png"></p>
<p>
 Put the <strong>Less Than</strong> (shaped like <strong>&lt; </strong>) block in the top If block's empty space. Put the <strong>Greater Than</strong> (shaped like <strong>&gt; </strong>) in the second, Otherwise If block's empty space.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_if_greater_than_etc.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 68: As mentioned previously, one of the numbers we want to compare is the Ship's position. We need a block that tells us that, and we can find it under the <strong>Actor </strong>category, <strong>Position </strong>sub-category, <strong>Position </strong>section; visible as <strong>x of Self</strong>.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_x_of_self.png"></p>
<p>
 We want to drag two of these blocks out; one for each of our comparison blocks (the &lt; and &gt; blocks). We need one in the left side for both. We need one more change for these two blocks, we want them to say "x (on screen)" instead of just "x". We can click on each one and change them easily with the drop-down menus that appear.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2_x_on_screen_of_self.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 69: Now that we have our first value to compare, we need a second value to compare it against. For our first comparison, we are just going to compare to 0; since an X value of zero is the left side of the screen. All we have to do is type a <strong>0 </strong>into the right half of the <strong>Less Than</strong> block.</p>
<p>
 The second, <strong>Greater Than,</strong> comparison will be slightly more complex, however. As previously noted, we have to account for the width of the actor on the right side. Let's get the following blocks and drop them side-by-side in the workspace.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>Minus </strong>(found in Numbers &amp; Text &gt; Math &gt; Arithmetic)</li>
 <li>
  <strong>Screen Width </strong>(found in Scene &gt; View &gt; Screen Bounds)</li>
 <li>
  <strong>Width of Self</strong> (found in Actor &gt; Properties &gt; Size)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_three_block_set_p1.png"></p>
<p>
 We then need to drag the <strong>Screen Width into the left side</strong> of the <strong>Minus </strong>block, and the <strong>Width of Self into the right side</strong>. The result will be a stack of blocks that looks like the below image.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_three_block_set_p2.png"></p>
<p>
 We need to drag this set of blocks into the other half of our second condition. Be sure to grab the Minus block to move them in, or we might only get one of the blocks inside of it instead.</p>
<p>
 Here's a image of what we should have so far.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2-Maintain-Position-Step1.png" style="width: 660px; height: 200px;"></p>
<p>
 Step 70: The goal of setting up these two conditions is to identify when the Ship has gone too far and has reached the edge of the screen. Since we now have those conditions set up, we can have something happen when they are true.</p>
<p>
 Given that our goal is to keep the Ship on the screen, we want to reset the position of our Ship Actor so that it is back on-screen anytime these conditions are met. To do so, we need two of the <strong>Set X to [ ] for Self</strong> blocks; one for each condition. Let's drag a couple out and put them where they belong.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_double_conditions_p1.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 71: Just like with the comparison for our condition, the first value is rather easy. We just need to put a <strong>1 </strong>into the block so it reads <strong>Set X to 1 for Self</strong>. Simply put, if our Ship is ever at 0 or less X position (further left than the left edge of the screen), we are going to force it back to 1 instead. This will prevent it from ever going off the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>
 Again, like our second comparison for our condition, the second value requires a few more blocks to do what we want it to. In this case, let's get the following blocks. Remember that you can <strong>ALT-drag</strong> on our existing blocks to duplicate them; you should do this to grab the entire stack out of the comparison.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <strong>Minus</strong></li>
 <li>
  <strong>Screen Width</strong></li>
 <li>
  <strong>Width of Self</strong></li>
 <li>
  <strong>Minus </strong>(yes, we need a second one)</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Again, we need the same math to subtract the width of the Ship from the width of the Screen. This time though, we put that stack of blocks inside the <strong>left side</strong> of the <strong>second Minus </strong>block. On the <strong>right side</strong>, we enter a value of <strong>1</strong> so our Ship gets replaced 1 pixel inside of the right edge of the screen.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/cc2_minus_stack_minus.png"></p>
<p>
 Step 72: Now we just need to take the above stack of blocks and insert it into the second <strong>Set X to [ ] for Self</strong> block in our conditionals. The complete set should look just like the image below.</p>
<p>
 <img alt="" src="./Crash Course 2  Invaders - Part 9 on Stencylpedia_files/CC2-Maintain-Position-Step2.png" style="width: 660px; height: 234px;"></p>
<p>
 Once you’ve got this new Event set up, test your game. If it’s working, and your Ship stays on screen, it’s time to move on to our next major Event!</p>
