	<h1>Pop-Up Arcade FAQ</h1>

	<p>Seven computers from Pop-Up Arcade are visiting your library this month.</p>

	<h2>Background</h2>

	<p>The arcade is meant to be messy and fun. Please relax and don't worry about breaking things :)</p>

	<p>Each computer runs a different NZ-made videogame. These games were made by individuals or small teams in a relatively short timeframe, often by people who are not trained programmers or game developers. Think of them as the zines of the videogames world.</p>

	<h2>Night time</h2>

	<p>Please turn off all the painted laptops at the end of each day, to let them cool down.</p>

	<p>Please do not turn off the cardboard arcade machine. (Just because it's a bit difficult to get to the power button.)</p>

	<p>How to shut down a computer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Quit the game [Alt+F4], click Start, choose Shut Down.</li>
		<li><em>Or</em> hold down the power button for 5 seconds.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Morning</h2>

	<p>Please turn on all of the computers in the morning</p>

	<p>Starting up computers</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Press the power button firmly</li>
		<li>Wait for them to start up (some are slow...)</li>
		<li>Then double-click on the desktop icon to start the game</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Tricky computers</h2>

	<p>Two games require a bit more setup:</p>

	<p>When you start <strong>Robofortress</strong>, it will be running in a Google Chrome. Please switch to full screen mode by doing this:</p>

	<p><img class="framed" src="chrome1.png"></p>

	<p><img class="framed" src="chrome2.png"></p>

	<p>When you start <strong>Attack of the Meeplings</strong> (the computer with legs) it might pop up a Java security warning instead of the game. Ignore the big "BLOCK" buttons, look for words like "Allow this to run" and click on them.</p>

	<p>If you turn off the <strong>cardboard arcade machine</strong>, you'll need to reach behind the machine to find the laptop hidden behind (sitting on the floor, partically open) to turn it on - then start the game, then put it back, not completely closed but almost closed so it stands up like an upside-down V. We recommend leaving it turned on so you don't need to do this.</p>

	<h3>Wait, where's the power button?</h3>

	<p><img class="framed" src="1.png"></p>

	<p><img class="framed" src="4.png"></p>
	<p><img class="framed" src="5.png"></p>
	<p><img class="framed" src="6.png"></p>

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

	<p>If anything goes wrong, you can usually quit the game (Alt+F4) then start it again.</p>

	<p>If this doesn't work, try restarting it (hold down the power button until the computer turns off, if neccessary.)</p>
